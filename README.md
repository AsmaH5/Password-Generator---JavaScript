# Password-Generator---JavaScript
This is a password generator app app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that I have written. My app has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, that  adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Aim:
To generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
* Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

* Character types:
    Lowercase,
    Uppercase,
    Numeric,
    Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

* Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Usage:
To use this Password-Generator, you will click the 'Generate Password' button and a alert will show up on your screen. From there, you will be presented with options such as: 
* Please enter desired password length.
* Would you like special characters in your password?
* Would you like numeric characters in your password?
* Would you like lower cased characters in your password?
* Would you like upper cased  characters in your password?
After answering all of the above questions a password will be presented on the screen.
